Some notes about RLS policies:
- Cities cannot be updated, inserted, or deleted by users
- Recommendations cannot be updated, inserted, or deleted by users (will need to change this when I allow users to add recs)
- Comments are viewable by everyone but only users can create, update, or delete their own comments
- Profiles are viewable by everyone but ^^
- Bucket lists are viewable by everyone but ^^
